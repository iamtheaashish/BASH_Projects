# BASH_Projects

A collection of Bash shell scripting projects, utilities, and automation scripts created as part of my learning journey in Linux and system administration. Focused on solving real-world tasks, building automation, and exploring the power of the terminal.

## Code Quality

All scripts in this repository follow best practices including:
- ✅ ShellCheck validation for static analysis
- ✅ Proper error handling and exit codes
- ✅ Dependency validation before execution
- ✅ Configurable through environment variables
- ✅ Structured logging with timestamps
- ✅ Resource cleanup and signal handling
