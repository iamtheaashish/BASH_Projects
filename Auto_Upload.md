# 📂 Bash Script: Auto-Upload File to Google Drive

This Bash script automatically uploads a specific file (`Prompt.txt`) to Google Drive **whenever it's updated**, using `rclone` and `inotifywait`.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I regularly use a file on my desktop (`Prompt.txt`) to store useful prompts generated by ChatGPT. Instead of manually backing it up, I wanted to automate this — both as a convenience and a learning exercise.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- [`rclone`](https://rclone.org/) — Sync files to Google Drive  
- [`inotify-tools`](https://github.com/inotify-tools/inotify-tools/wiki) — Monitor file changes  
- `systemd` user service — Automatically run the script at boot

## 🧩 How It Works

- Watches `Prompt.txt` for changes using `inotifywait`
- On change, uploads it to a specific Google Drive folder using `rclone`
- Configured to run automatically on system boot via systemd

## 🖥️ Environment

- Host OS: Debian 12  
- Script Location: `~/.local/bin/auto_upload.sh`  
- Systemd Unit: `~/.config/systemd/user/auto_upload.service`

## 🙏 Credits

While I came up with the idea and wrote the script, I used ChatGPT to help discover and configure tools like `rclone` and `inotifywait`.
